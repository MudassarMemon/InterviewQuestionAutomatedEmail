# Interview Prep System (InterviewQuestionAutomatedEmail)

In the face of a highly competitive job market, preparing for a software engineering role demands consistency and organization across various areas â€“ from Leetcode and building an online presence to researching companies and honing interview skills. I've implemented a time blocking schedule for myself to help me cover these tasks but I need something that helps me stay consistent and accountable. 

Recognizing the need for a systematic approach, I've crafted an automated email tool that delivers daily interview questions. This ensures dedicated attention to both general and technical coding concepts, as well as behavioral interview queries. My goal is simple: answer one question each day to refine and sharpen my skills systematically. Here's to a purposeful and successful interview preparation journey!
