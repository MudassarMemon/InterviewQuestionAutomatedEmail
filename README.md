# Interview Prep System (InterviewQuestionAutomatedEmail)

In the face of a highly competitive job market, preparing for a software engineering role demands consistency and organization across various areas â€“ from Leetcode and building an online presence to researching companies and honing interview skills. I've implemented a time blocking schedule for myself to help me cover these tasks but I wanted something more. Recognizing the need for a systematic approach, I've crafted an automated email tool that delivers daily interview questions. This ensures dedicated attention to both general and technical coding concepts, as well as behavioral interview queries. My goal is simple: answer one question each day to refine and sharpen my skills systematically. Here's to a purposeful and successful interview preparation journey!

### Technologies used to create this app:
- openpyxl: Python library that allows you to read/write excel files
- smtplib: Python library that allows you to send emails
- python-crontab: Python module that automates script execution

### Future implementations:
- consider GPT4 intergration that reviews your answer and provides constructive feedback
